# ü§ñ QueryCraft: The Text-to-SQL BI Tool

**QueryCraft** is a self-service Business Intelligence (BI) tool that allows non-technical users to query a database using plain English. It leverages a Generative AI model to translate natural language into executable SQL queries, democratizing data access for everyone.

This project is built as a full-stack Python application, featuring a **FastAPI** backend for the AI and database logic, and a **Streamlit** frontend for a clean, interactive user experience.

### üöÄ The Problem & Opportunity

In most companies, data is locked behind a "technical wall." Business users in sales, marketing, or finance need insights but don't know SQL. They must file a ticket with a data analyst, creating a slow and expensive bottleneck.

**QueryCraft** solves this by providing a simple chat interface that acts as an AI data analyst, translating questions like "What were our top 5 best-selling albums last year?" directly into SQL.
